Peralta, A.L., Muscarella, M.E. and Matthews, J.W., 2017. Wetland management strategies lead to tradeoffs in ecological structure and function. Elem Sci Anth, 5, p.74. DOI: http://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.253

Raw sequences files can be found at NCBI SRA [BioProject ID PRJNA393844](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA393844).

## We address the following questions

* **Aim 1.)**: To what degree does restoration strategy impact plant and soil microbial community composition and the soil environment?

* **Aim 2.)**: How does restoration strategy influence wetland community composition compared to reference floodplain wetland conditions? 

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:**: An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Mario Muscarella and Ariane Peralta containing functions used in analysis of plant, soil, and microbial sequence data.

* **bin:** 
	* *MothurTools.R*: An R script written by Mario Muscarella (Indiana University, now at University of Illinois) containing functions used in the analysis of community sequence data.

* **data:**: Files associated with plant, soil, and microbial data sets. 

* **figures:**: Figures (of plant, soil, microbes) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.

* **mothur:**: Files containing script for bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Illumina MiSeq platform) using mothur pipeline.
