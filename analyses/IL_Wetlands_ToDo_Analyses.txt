Illinois Wetlands Project 

To Do

(1) Plant community composition graph (need to standardize data) - data file: IL_Wetlands_HC_Plants.xlsx

—Run PERMANOVA (done)
—Run PCoA (done)

(2) Box plots of soil factors across treatment and ANOVA (most will be NS except temp maybe) - data file: WL_plant_soil.csv

soil moisture
soil temp
pH
total organic carbon
total nitrogen
organic matter (%)
ammonium-N
nitrate-N

(3) Box plot of reed canary grass (invasive species) across treatment - data file: WL_plant_soil.csv

(4) Phylogenetic analyses - bacterial community ?
